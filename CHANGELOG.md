# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`doctor --fix`** — Interactive auto-repair flow for common environment issues
    - Diagnoses the environment, remediates in deterministic order, re-checks, and prints a structured summary
    - Four in-scope repair classes: stale manifest migration, missing devcontainer regeneration, Node.js version fix (nvm / fnm / volta), and Docker daemon guidance
    - Every finding resolves to exactly one outcome: `fixed`, `already compliant`, `skipped`, or `requires manual action`
    - Atomic writes with timestamped backups for all manifest and generated-artifact changes
    - Prerequisite ordering: manifest migration always runs before devcontainer regeneration; regeneration is skipped if migration fails
    - `--fix --json` outputs a machine-readable `FixRun` object with `initialFindings`, `executions`, `finalFindings`, `summary` counts, and `exitDisposition`
    - Exit code `1` only when unresolved failures remain after the run
- **`DiagnosticFinding`, `RemediationAction`, `FixExecution`, `FixRun`, `FixOutcomeSummary`** types exported from `tool/schema/types.ts`
- **`doctor --fix` documentation** — added to `docs/quick-reference.md` with fix vocabulary, fixable issue table, safety notes, and JSON schema example
- **`docs/specs/004-doctor-fix/spec.md`** — feature spec committed per repository spec-first policy

### Changed

- **`doctor` timeout fix** — added 5 s timeout to all `docker info`, `docker --version`, and `docker compose version` subprocess calls; prevents test hangs in environments without Docker
- **`doctor` check metadata** — check functions now populate `fixEligibility` and `remediationKey` fields on `CheckResult` for use by the fix flow; the legacy `fixable` boolean is still emitted for backward compatibility

### Fixed

- **`${containerEnv:HOME}` in mount targets** — replaced with absolute path `/home/vscode/.codex` in examples and codex overlay README; Docker cannot resolve container env vars at mount time
- **`pandoc` overlay missing `lmodern`** — added `lmodern` package to the apt package list; required by Pandoc's default LaTeX template on Trixie where `--no-install-recommends` skips it

### Changed

- **Flat `overlays` field in project config** — project files now use a single `overlays` array instead of per-category keys (`language`, `database`, `devTools`, `cloudTools`, `observability`)
    - Users no longer need to know which category an overlay belongs to — just list overlay IDs
    - Old category keys are still parsed for backward compatibility and merged into the flat list
    - Internally backed by a strongly-typed `OverlayId` union type for compile-time safety

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **`pandoc` overlay** — Complete Markdown → PDF pipeline with Pandoc, XeLaTeX, and optional Mermaid diagram rendering
    - Installs Pandoc 3.x from the official GitHub release (not the outdated apt version)
    - TeX Live / XeLaTeX with Carlito, JetBrains Mono, and Noto Sans Symbols 2 fonts for clean Unicode output
    - `diagram.lua` Lua filter from pandoc-ext/diagram for fenced `mermaid` code block rendering
    - Mermaid CLI (`mmdc`) installed automatically when the `nodejs` overlay is present; skipped gracefully otherwise
    - System Chromium wired to Puppeteer with `--no-sandbox` for headless Mermaid rendering inside containers
    - Ready-to-use `~/.pandoc/pandoc.yaml` defaults file with XeLaTeX engine, font, and table settings
- **Adopt project-file output** — `adopt --project-file` now writes a repository-root project config alongside the manifest
    - Reuses an existing `.superposition.yml` or `superposition.yml` when present to avoid dual-file ambiguity
    - Carries inferred output path, container name, overlay selections, and supported customizations into the generated project file
- **Project-root selection for persisted input** — `init` and `regen` now accept `--project-root <path>`
    - Lets you load a repository project file or discover a manifest from another directory without changing shells first
    - Relative output paths from the selected project file continue to resolve from that repository root
- **`minimal-trixie` example** — Lightweight project-file-driven example using Debian Trixie with Codex and a `~/.codex` host mount
- **`kitchen-sink` example** — Comprehensive reference example exercising every `superposition.yml` field: preset with parameter choices, additional overlays, port offset, deployment target, editor profile, and the full customizations block (patches, environment, scripts, files)

### Fixed

- **`cross-distro-packages` feature** — Package declarations can now use fallback names like `pkgA|pkgB`
    - Allows overlays such as `pandoc` to handle Debian-vs-Ubuntu package-name differences without embedding apt-specific detection logic in setup scripts

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Project config generation** — Standard `init` can now read a repository-root `.superposition.yml` or `superposition.yml`
    - Lets teams and CI run generation from committed declarative defaults instead of reconstructing long CLI commands
    - `regen` now supports `--from-project`, uses the repository project file by default when present, and consistently behaves as deterministic replay across project-file and manifest-based persisted sources
    - `init` remains the editable flow, so persisted sources can still prefill the questionnaire when you want to modify a generated setup instead of replaying it exactly
    - Direct CLI flags still override the project config for one run, while explicit `--from-manifest` regeneration remains isolated
    - Conflicting persisted-input source combinations such as `--from-project --from-manifest` or source mode plus structural selection flags now fail before generation with a clear source-conflict error
    - Supports parity for the existing clean-generation surface, including custom images, container naming, minimal/editor settings, environment variables, and additional generated features declared through custom patches
- **Verbose plan narration** — `plan --verbose` now explains why each overlay was included
    - Shows direct selections, required dependencies, and dependency paths in the terminal output
    - Supports `plan --from-manifest <path> --verbose` so existing manifests get the same explanation model as explicit overlay lists
    - Adds structured inclusion reasons to `plan --json --verbose` without changing the default JSON shape
    - Calls out skipped overlays and conflict boundaries so dependency resolution is easier to audit
- **`spec-kit` overlay** — Spec-Driven Development with the `specify` CLI and any supported AI coding agent
    - Installs `uv` (Astral's fast Python package manager) and `specify-cli` from [github/spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)
    - Supports 20+ AI agents: Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Amp, opencode, and more
    - Usage: `specify init . --here --ai <agent>` after overlay setup
- **`claude-code` overlay** — Anthropic Claude Code CLI (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code`) for AI-powered terminal development
- **`gemini-cli` overlay** — Google Gemini CLI (`@google/gemini-cli`) for AI-powered terminal development
- **`amp` overlay** — Sourcegraph Amp CLI (`@sourcegraph/amp`) for AI-powered terminal development
- **`windsurf-cli` overlay** — Codeium Windsurf CLI for AI-powered terminal development
- **`opencode` overlay** — opencode AI coding agent (`opencode-ai`) for multi-provider terminal development
- **`sdd` preset** — Spec-Driven Development meta-preset bundling `spec-kit` with a user-selectable AI agent CLI
    - Prompts users to choose from: Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Amp, Windsurf, opencode, or GitHub Copilot (IDE-integrated)
    - Sets `SPECIFY_AI_AGENT` environment variable automatically to match the chosen agent
- **`hash` command** — Deterministic environment fingerprint for drift detection and reproducibility
    - Produces a stable SHA-256 fingerprint from stack, resolved overlays, preset, base image, and tool version
    - Auto-resolves overlay dependencies (same logic as `plan`) so the hash includes transitively required overlays
    - Works standalone (`--stack`/`--overlays` flags) or reads directly from an existing `superposition.json` manifest
    - `--json` flag emits machine-readable JSON with both a short 8-character `hash` (for display/badges) and the full 64-character `hashFull` (for CI comparison)
    - `--write` flag writes the full hash to `.devcontainer/superposition.hash` alongside the manifest
    - Hash is version-stable across patch releases (uses `major.minor` of the tool version only)
    - Full documentation at [`docs/hash.md`](docs/hash.md)
- **`adopt` command** — Adopt an existing `.devcontainer/` into the overlay-based model
    - Reads `devcontainer.json` and any linked `docker-compose.yml` files and analyses their contents
    - Resolves the `dockerComposeFile` field (string or array, relative paths) to support Docker Compose-based devcontainers where the compose file lives outside the `.devcontainer/` directory
    - Maps detected devcontainer features, Docker Compose service images, VS Code extensions, and `remoteEnv` variables to equivalent overlay IDs
    - Detection tables are **built dynamically from the overlay registry** — no hardcoded overlay names, every overlay is automatically supported
    - Best-match scoring ensures a feature used by multiple overlays (e.g. the Node.js feature shared by `nodejs` and `bun`) is assigned to the most appropriate one
    - Displays a table showing each detected signal → suggested overlay with a confidence level (`exact` or `heuristic`)
    - Prints the equivalent `container-superposition init` command to reproduce the configuration, using correct CLI flags per overlay category (`--language`, `--database`, `--observability`, `--cloud-tools`, `--dev-tools`)
    - **Unmatched items** (features, services, extensions not covered by any overlay) are surfaced separately; a `custom/devcontainer.patch.json` / `custom/docker-compose.patch.yml` is written to preserve them across regenerations
    - Backup support using the same auto-detect logic as `regen` — skipped in git repos by default; use `--backup` / `--no-backup` / `--backup-dir` to override
    - `--dry-run` flag prints the analysis without writing any files
    - Prompts to generate `superposition.json` (and optionally `custom/` patch files) from the suggestions
    - `--force` flag allows overwriting existing generated files
    - `--json` flag for machine-readable output (suitable for scripting)
    - Gracefully handles configs with no recognisable overlay patterns
    - Full documentation at [`docs/adopt.md`](docs/adopt.md)

## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Keycloak overlay** — Open-source identity and access management for local OAuth2/OIDC development
    - Runs as a Docker Compose service on port 8180 (avoids collision with common app servers)
    - Automatically requires and integrates with the `postgres` overlay as its database backend
    - Exposes OIDC discovery at `/realms/master/.well-known/openid-configuration`
    - `KEYCLOAK_HOST`, `KEYCLOAK_PORT`, and `KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` wired into the dev container via `remoteEnv`
- **Mailpit overlay** — Email testing tool that captures all outbound email locally
    - SMTP server on port 1025 (no authentication required in dev mode)
    - Web UI on port 8025 for browsing captured emails
    - REST API at `/api/v1/messages` for automated test assertions
    - `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, and `MAILPIT_URL` wired into the dev container via `remoteEnv`
- **gRPC Tools overlay** — Protocol Buffers and gRPC development toolchain
    - Installs `protoc` (via system packages), `buf` CLI, and `grpcurl` (from official GitHub releases, multi-arch)
    - VS Code extensions: `vscode-proto3` and `vscode-buf`
    - Works with all base stacks (plain and compose)
- **Cloudflared overlay** — Cloudflare Tunnel for securely exposing local services to the internet
    - Anonymous tunnels work immediately with no account required
    - Named tunnels support persistent URLs with a Cloudflare account
    - Conflicts with `ngrok` overlay (bidirectional — both overlays declare the conflict)
    - Pinned to a specific release version for reproducibility

- **Service reference exports** — Two convenience files are now auto-generated during `init` and `regen` for projects that include service overlays
    - `services.md` — Consolidated service reference with connection info, connection strings (URIs), code examples (Node.js, Python) for common services, common CLI commands, port offset documentation, and a troubleshooting section
    - `env.local.example` — Optional-overrides template derived from each overlay's `.env.example`, with all values commented out and grouped by service — copy to `.env` and uncomment only what you need to customize
    - Both files are tracked in the file registry and cleaned up on regeneration alongside other generated files

- **Git-aware backup defaults** — Backups are now skipped automatically when the target directory is inside a git repository (git already tracks history), and created by default when it is not
    - `--backup` flag forces a backup even inside a git repo
    - `--no-backup` flag suppresses a backup even outside a git repo
    - Auto-detection uses `git rev-parse --git-dir`; falls back to walking up the directory tree looking for a `.git` folder when the `git` command is unavailable
- **Automatic `.gitignore` management** — Generated projects now include tool-specific `.gitignore` entries automatically; overlay-provided patterns are merged into your project root `.gitignore` at generation time
    - Entries from each overlay are grouped under a labelled comment for easy identification
    - Running generation again never duplicates patterns already in your `.gitignore`
    - Overlay-provided ignore rules are always applied to the project root `.gitignore` (never to files inside `.devcontainer/`), keeping generated configuration isolated from your application's source ignores
- **direnv overlay: secrets and env files are gitignored automatically** — `.envrc.local`, `.env`, `.env.local`, and `.direnv/` are now excluded from git immediately after generation — no need to start the container first
- **Python overlay: workspace virtual environment (`.venv`)** — The Python overlay now sets up a `.venv` virtual environment in your project root on container creation
    - VS Code automatically uses the workspace `.venv` as the Python interpreter
    - All project dependencies are installed into the venv (`requirements.txt`, `requirements-dev.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`)
    - `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, and other Python artifacts are added to `.gitignore` automatically
- **Preset parameterization** — Customize presets with high-level choices without micro-managing individual overlays
    - New `parameters` field in preset definitions maps choices to sets of overlays
    - `web-api` preset now parameterized: `database`, `cache`, `broker`, `observability` slots
    - `microservice` preset now parameterized: `broker`, `observability` slots
    - Interactive questionnaire asks for each parameter value with descriptions and defaults
    - `--preset <id>` CLI flag pre-selects a preset and skips the preset selection prompt
    - `--preset-param <key=value>` CLI flag pre-fills parameter values (repeatable)
    - Pre-filled parameters skip their interactive prompt; unfilled ones are still asked
    - Invalid parameter values produce helpful error messages listing valid options
    - `explain <preset-id>` now shows parameters, options, defaults, and usage examples
    - Example: `container-superposition init --preset web-api --preset-param broker=nats --preset-param observability=full`
- **`plan --diff`** — Compare planned output vs existing `.devcontainer/` configuration before applying changes
    - Shows files to be created, modified, unchanged, and removed
    - Generates colored unified diff for `devcontainer.json` (loads base template + applies overlay patches)
    - Detects overlay changes (added/removed) by comparing with existing `superposition.json` manifest
    - Detects port changes (added/removed) derived from overlay comparison
    - Lists preserved custom files in `custom/` directory
    - `--output <path>` to compare against a custom existing config path (default: `./.devcontainer`)
    - `--diff-format json` for machine-readable output (also via `--json`)
    - `--diff-context <lines>` to control diff context lines (default: 3)
    - Example: `container-superposition plan --stack compose --overlays postgres,redis --diff`
